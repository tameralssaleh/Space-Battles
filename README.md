# Space Battles

**Space Battles** is a 2D space-themed game where you battle multiple waves of enemy ships which get stronger as you progress.

## Version

## Change Log 0.1 -> 0.1.1 (Stable) August 15, 2024
- Added a crashdata directory. This will be used for handling any erorrs or crashes that may occur when running SpaceBattles. This will allow you to report bugs easier just by sending in the .txt file with the date and time of the crash as it's file name. I plan to make this even better in the near future.

- Your commander has also requested you to collect as many space-crystals as you can to bring profits to the nation!
