# Space Battles

**Space Battles** is a 2D space-themed game where you battle multiple waves of enemy ships which get stronger as you progress.

## Version
- Alpha 0.1
- Notice: As this game is in Alpha, there is to be expected bugs that may come around any time.

## Instructions
- To play the game, you need to download the SpaceBattles.zip file and extract to /SpaceBattles.

## Change Log 0.1 -> 0.1.1 (Stable) August 15, 2024
- Added a crashdata directory. This will be used for handling any erorrs or crashes that may occur when running SpaceBattles. This will allow you to report bugs easier just by sending in the .txt file with the date and time of the crash as it's file name. I plan to make this even better in the near future.

## Objective
- Your commander has instructed you to attack and clear out as many enemy positions in the nearby star system.
- Your commander has also requested you to destroy the motherships that arrive on each 10th level/wave. These motherships are deadly and pose a risk to the nation.
- Your commander has also requested you to collect as many space-crystals as you can to bring profits to the nation!

## Items
- Heart: After passing level 5, a heart has a 2% chance to spawn each second that passes by on each proceeding level. Collect these hearts to fully heal yourself!
- Crystal: These blue shiny crystals have a 10% chance to spawn in every level every three seconds. Collecting them will give you 300 extra bonus points added to your score.
